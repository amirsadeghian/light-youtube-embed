# Light Youtube Embed

## Problem Statement
Everyone likes Youtube service. The problem starts when a company that has a YOutube channel wants to embed many of their YouTube videos on a single webpage. This will significantly impact their page speed and causes a bad user experience.

## Proposed Solution
In this project, I try to replace the Youtube embed iframes with thumbnail images from the Youtube video and load the video on demand to avoid loading many additional resources per video. I am going to use Javascript to build this project.
